#Flappybird for MATLAB

#### Author: Mingjing Zhang

As one of the most popular games on app stores before being taken down, Flappy Bird does not need any further introduction. Now, it has come back alive, on MATLAB. 

This implementation is intentionally made to replicate the user experience of the original game, with all physical dimensions of objects being identical. The gravity and 'jumping pulse' are also carefully adjusted so that they match the original as closely as possible.

*MATLAB R2014a is recommended for this game to achieve the best graphical performance

## Usage:
Simply execute flappybird.m. Alternatively, you can install "Flappy Bird.mlappinstal" as a MATLAB app.

## Control:
Spacebar/Return/Uparrow/W/ -> Jump/Start game/Restart game; 
ESC -> Quit Game.

## Note:
This game app features a few technique breakthroughs that I utilize in a game for the first time. For instance, the bird sprite is represented as a SURFACE object, as opposed to an IMAGE object, so that it can easily rotate at any angle.

Enjoy the endless flapping!
